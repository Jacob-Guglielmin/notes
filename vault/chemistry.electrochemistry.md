## Terms
* Oxidation: Losing electrons
* Reduction: Gaining electrons
* Oxidizing agent: A substance that causes the oxidization of another substance by undergoing reduction
* Reducing agent: A substance that causes the reduction of another substance by undergoing oxidization
* Disproportionation reaction: Reaction in which reducing agent and oxidizing agent are the same substance
* Half-reaction: Each reaction in redox is called a half-reaction - oxidization is one half, reduction is the other half
* Oxidation number/oxidation state: The charge that an atom appears to have when electron pairs in covalent bonds belong entirely to the more electronegative atom

## Redox Reactions
* Redox reactions are chemical reactions where electrons are transferred from one species to another
* Number of electrons lost = number of electrons gained during reaction
* Ions can be converted to atoms or other ions, atoms are converted to ions
* Must be balanced by both mass and charge
* Usually, the oxidizing agent and reducing agent are different subastances, but they can be the same substance, as in $3Fe^{2+}_{(aq)}→2Fe^{3+}_{(aq)}+Fe_{(s)}$ - this is called a disproportionation reaction

## Writing Half-reactions
* Electrons are represented as their own term in the equation
* Example oxidization half-reactions:
    * $Al_{(s)}→Al^{3+}_{(aq)}+3e\text{-}$
    * $2I^{-}_{(aq)}→I_{2(s)}+2e\text{-}$
* Example reduction half-reactions:
    * $Cu^{2+}_{(aq)}+2e\text{-}→Cu_{(s)}$
    * $Fe^{3+}_{(aq)}+1e\text{-}→Fe^{2+}$

## Assigning Oxidation Numbers
Atom or Ion | Oxidation Number | Examples
---------|----------|---------
All Elements | $0$ | $Na$ is $0$<br>$Cl$ in $Cl_2$ is $0$
Simple Ions | Charge on the ion | $Na^+$ is $+1$<br>$S^{2-}$ is $-2$
Oxygen | $-2$ | $O$ in $H_2O$ is $-2$
Oxygen in peroxides | $-1$ | $O$ in $H_2O_2$ is $-1$
Hydrogen | $+1$ | $H$ in $HCl$ is $+1$
Hydrogen in hydrides | $-1$ | $H$ in $LiH$ is $-1$
All others | Calculated | [[Examples\|chemistry.electrochemistry#calculating-oxidation-numbers]]

### Calculating Oxidation Numbers
* In all compounds, the oxidation numbers **MUST** add up to the charge on the compound
    * Ex. $CO_2$ has a charge of $0$. Since each $O$ must have a charge of $-2$, and there are 2 of them, the charge required to balance it is $+4$. Therefore, the $C$ has an oxidation number of $+4$.
* In all polyatomic ions, the oxidation numbers **MUST** add up to the charge on the ion

## Balancing using Oxidation Numbers
* Redox reactions can be balanced by looking at the change in the oxidation numbers
* The total increase in oxidation numbers in the reaction is always equal to the total decrease

## Spontaneity of Redox Reactions
* A spontaneous redox reaction will only occur if the oxidizing agent is above the reducing agent in the table of relative strengths in the data booklet
* If they are at the same level, it is also non-spontaneous
* In the data table:
    * Oxidizing agents are on the left, with the strongest at the top, whereas reducing agents are on the right with the strongest at the bottom
    * Oxidation half-reactions are read left to right, whereas reduction half-reactions are read right to left
