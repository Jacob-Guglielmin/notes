## Alkanes
* Alkanes are hydrocarbons containing only single bonds and only carbon and hydrogen. Ex. $CH_4$
    * All alkanes have the same generic formula: $C_nH_{2n+2}$
    * The names of all alkanes end in -ane
    * The prefix before the -ane denotes the number of carbons:
        1. Meth-
        1. Eth-
        1. Prop-
        1. But-
        * Any amount of carbons at least 5 uses the standard numbering - pent-, hex-, hept-...

## Alkyl Branches
* The name of a compound indicates if the carbon chain has a branch
* To name a branch, you use the number of carbons + -yl before the name of the alkane
    * For example, a branch with one carbon on a butane would be called methylbutane
* Because a branch adds carbons and hydrogens in the same quantities as simply extending the main carbon chain, we can end up with multiple molecules with the same formula
    * Ex. methylbutane and pentane are both $C_5H_{12}$
    * These compounds are called structural isomers

## Naming Hydrocarbons
1. Identify the longest continuous chain of carbons - this is the "parent"
1. Number the carbons from the end closest to the branches such that the branches come off the lowest numbered carbons - add them up and select the lowest number
1. Identify each branch and find their location number on the parent chain
1. If there is only one possible location for every branch, we are done - name the branches, then the main alkane, such as methylbutane - this can only have a methyl group from the second carbon
1. If there is more than one possible configuration, prefix each branch name with its location - Ex. 2-methyl if there is a methyl group coming off the second carbon on the parent chain, or 3-ethyl if there is an ethyl group coming off the third carbon
1. If there is more than one of the same branch, don't keep all the names like 2-methyl-3-methyl - instead convert it to 2,3-dimethyl
1. Order all the branch names such that they are in alphabetical order, such as 3-ethyl-2-methyl
1. Add the name of the parent chain to the end - 3-ethyl-2-methylhexane

## Drawing Hydrocarbons
### Structural Diagrams
1. Draw a straight chain with the number of carbons being the same as the number indicated by the name
1. Attach all listed branches to their locations on the chain
1. Add hydrogens to each carbon until every carbon has 4 single bonds

### Condensed Diagrams
* Essentially the same as structural diagrams, but don't add bonds for the hydrogens, just add their amounts as a chemical formula to the carbon that they are attached to

### Line Diagrams
* Each end or change in direction on the line represents a carbon atom
* Hydrogen atoms are just inferred
