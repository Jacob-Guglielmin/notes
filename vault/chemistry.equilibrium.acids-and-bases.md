## Acids/Bases
* Arrhenius definition:
    * Acids produce hydronium ($H_3O^+$) when reacting with water
    * Bases produce hydroxide ($OH^-$) when reacting with water
* Bronsted-Lowry definition:
    * Acids donate a proton to another species in solution (proton donors)
    * Bases accept a proton from another species in solution (proton acceptors)
* When a substance can either donate **OR** accept a proton depending on the solution, it is called amphoteric/amphiprotic
* In the case where multiple amphoteric/amphiprotic substances react, the stronger acid will donate the proton, and the stronger base will accept the proton
* Strong acids
    * Low pH
    * First 6 acids in data booklet
    * Anything else is weak
    * Ionize 100% (quantitative - one direction arrow)
* Weak acids
    * Higher pH, but still below 7
    * Do not ionize completely (not quantitative - equilibrium arrows)
* Strong bases
    * High pH
    * Have $OH^-$
    * Dissociate 100% (quantitative - one direction arrow)
    * Group I metals and $Ba$ and $Sr$ in front
* Weak bases
    * Lower pH, but still above 7
    * Do not dissociate completely (not quantitative - equilibrium arrows)
* **STRONGEST ACID REACTS WITH THE STRONGEST BASE**
* Any reaction containing a strong acid or base is **ALWAYS** quantitative
* In the data booklet, the strongest acids go from top to bottom on the left only, and the strongest bases go from bottom to top on the right only
* Conjugate pair
    * Two related compounds or ions

    * The stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base (and vice versa)

## Using $K_a$
* $HA_{(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)}⇄H_3O^+_{(aq)}+A^-_{(aq)}$
* General formula: $K_a=\frac{[H_3O^+_{(aq)}][A^-_{(aq)}]}{[HA_{(aq)}]}$
* Larger $K_a$: stronger acid
* If there is a divide by zero (no acid remaining), the $K_a$ can be written as $\infty$ or "very large"
* For strong acids (react completely), just plug in the stoich like Chem 20
* For weak acids, you have to do an ICE table
    * Solving for concentrations can be made *much* easier if $\frac{[HA]}{K_a}>1000$ (if you are only using 2 significant digits)
        * If it is, you can drop the $-x$ that will end up in the denominator from the equation, as its effect will be negligible

## $K_w$ and $K_b$
* $K_w$ is the ionization constant of water ($1×10^{-14}$)
* Since $K_b$ is never given in the data booklet, we can obtain it using the $K_a$ of the conjugate acid and $K_w$
* $K_b=\frac{K_w}{K_a}$

## Buffer Solutions
* A solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base
* Ex. $CH_3COOH_{(aq)}$ and $CH_3COO^-_{(aq)}$
* Prevents strong acids and bases from changing the pH of the solution if they are added, as long as the quantity of the acid or base is less than the quantity of buffer
* When a strong acid or strong base is added to the solution, it reacts with the base or acid in the buffer solution, and gets converted into a much weaker acid or base
* Buffer region - the area on a titration curve where the pH resists significant change
    * ![](/assets/images/2022-04-13-08-51-38.png)
    * On this curve, the buffer region is the area from $0$ to around $25$
* Buffer capacity
    * The limit of a buffer's ability to resist pH change
    * Once either the acid or base in the buffer is fully consumed, the buffering fails, causing a sharp change in pH as shown in the titration curve above
* Buffers are important in biological systems as they help maintain a constant pH in substances like blood
