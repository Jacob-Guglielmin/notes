## Acids/Bases
* Arrhenius definition:
    * Acids produce hydronium ($H_3O^+$) when reacting with water
    * Bases produce hydroxide ($OH^-$) when reacting with water
* Bronsted-Lowry definition:
    * Acids donate a proton to another species in solution (proton donors)
    * Bases accept a proton from another species in solution (proton acceptors)
* When a substance can either donate **OR** accept a proton depending on the solution, it is called amphoteric/amphiprotic
* Strong acids
    * Low pH
    * First 6 acids in data booklet
    * Anything else is weak
    * Ionize 100% (quantitative - one direction arrow)
* Weak acids
    * Higher pH, but still below 7
    * Do not ionize completely (not quantitative - equilibrium arrows)
* Strong bases
    * High pH
    * Have $OH^-$
    * Dissociate 100% (quantitative - one direction arrow)
    * Group I metals and $Ba$ and $Sr$ in front
* Weak bases
    * Lower pH, but still above 7
    * Do not dissociate completely (not quantitative - equilibrium arrows)
* **STRONGEST ACID REACTS WITH THE STRONGEST BASE**
* Any reaction containing a strong acid or base is **ALWAYS** quantitative
* In the data booklet, the strongest acids go from top to bottom on the left only, and the strongest bases go from bottom to top on the right only
* Conjugate pair
    * Two related compounds or ions

    * The stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base (and vice versa)
