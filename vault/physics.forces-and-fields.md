## Symbols
### Fomulas
$q$: charge  
$V$: voltage  
$k$: Coulomb's constant ($9×10^9$)  
$e$: Elementary charge ($1.6×10^{-19}\>C$)  
$B$: Magnetic field  
$I$: Current  
### Diagrams
x : magnetic field pointing away  
**·** : magnetic field pointing toward

## Terms
Solenoid: A coil of wire around a ferromagnetic material  

## Coulomb's Law
* $F_e=\frac{k|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$
* Attractive and repulsive
    * Attractive when $q_1$ and $q_2$ have opposite signs
    * Repulsive when $q_1$ and $q_2$ have the same signs

## Voltage
* Voltage is electric potential energy
    * As energy, it obeys the laws of thermodynamics

## Electric Field of Point Charge
* $|E|=\frac{k|q|}{r^2}$

## Magnetism
* There are 2 forms of magnetism:
    * Magnetic field in space
    * Originating from a moving charge
* Magnetic force: $F_b=qvB\sin{θ}$

### Hand Rules for Magnetism
#### Magnetic Fields
Index finger: Field lines  
Thumb: Direction of motion of charge  
Middle: Direction of magnetic force  
Left hand: -, unconventional current  
Right hand: +, conventional current

#### Current
Thumb: Direction of current  
Fingers: Roll in direction of magnetic field  
**RIGHT HAND ONLY**

## Lenz's Law
NO FORMULAS FOR LENZ'S LAW IN PHYSICS 30
* In a solenoid, current will flow through the coil in the direction of the north side of the resulting magnetic field
