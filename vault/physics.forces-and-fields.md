## Symbols
$q$: charge  
$V$: voltage  
$k$: Coulomb's constant ($9×10^9$)  
$e$: Elementary charge ($1.6×10^{-19}\>C$)

## Coulomb's Law
* $F_e=\frac{k|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$
* Attractive and repulsive
    * Attractive when $q_1$ and $q_2$ have opposite signs
    * Repulsive when $q_1$ and $q_2$ have the same signs

## Voltage
* Voltage is electric potential energy
    * As energy, it obeys the laws of thermodynamics
