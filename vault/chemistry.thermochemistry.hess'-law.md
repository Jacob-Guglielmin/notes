## What is Hess' law?

* The total change in enthalpy is equal to the sum of the enthalpy change in all steps in a reaction
* For example: 
    * $A+B→C+D\>ΔH=4\>kJ$
    * $C+D→E+F\>ΔH=6\>kJ$
    * Because $C+D$ is only an intermediate step to get from $A+B$ to $E+F$, the $C+D$ can be canceled out and the $ΔH$s can be added together to get $A+B→E+F\>ΔH=10\>kJ$
* If one of the equations is backward, such as in our first example $E+F→C+D\>ΔH=-6\>kJ$, the equation can be reversed and the sign of $ΔH$ changed in order to get a more useful equation
    * The reactants must be on the left, and the products on the right - if they are not, reverse equations until there is a chain from reactants to products
* If the intermediate products don't cancel, you can multiply or divide equations to make the coefficients right, as long as you also multiply or divide the $ΔH$ - fractions are allowed
* The enthalpy of any reaction can also be calculated using the molar enthalpy of formation of all the compounds in the reaction: $ΔH_r=\sum{}nH_{fp}-\sum{}nH_{fr}$
    * The total enthalpy change is equal to the sum of the molar enthalpy of formation of all the products minus the sum of the molar enthalpy of formation of all the reactants
