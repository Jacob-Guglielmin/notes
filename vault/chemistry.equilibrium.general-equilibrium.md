## Types of Equilibrium
* Phase equilibrium
    * One substance in multiple phases
    * Ex. Ice in water at 0 °C - water freezes at the rate that ice melts
* Solubility equilibrium
    * Single solute in solvent
    * Ex. Salt in saturated water - salt precipitates at the same rate that it dissolves
* Chemical reaction equilibrium
    * Several substances together
    * Either reactants or products could be favoured in terms of quantity
    * The rate of the forward reaction is the same as the rate of the reverse reaction

## Describing Equilibrium
* % Yield
    * Equilibrium for one substance
    * $\frac{P_{actual}}{P_{maximum}}×100$
    * Maximum yield is calculated using stoich
* Equilibrium constant
    * All substances of a reaction at the same temperature

## Types of Chemical Reaction Equilibrium
* Non-spontaneous (no apparent reaction)
    * % Yield is negligible
* Products favoured
    * % Yield is $>50\%$
* Reactants favoured
    * % Yield is $<50\%$
* Quantitative (complete reaction)
    * % Yield is $>99.9\%$

## Stress in Reactions
* A stress is any process that disturbs the reaction
    * Change in temperature
    * Change in pressure (when a gas is involved)
    * Change in concentration of reactants
    * Change in concentration of products
    * Change in mass
    * Change in volume
* The reaction will shift its equilibrium either toward the products or reactants in response to a stress

Variable | Imposed Change | Result
---------|----------------|-------
Concentration | Increase | Shift to opposite side from added substance
Concentration | Decrease | Shift to same side as added substance
Temperature | Increase | Shift to consume heat energy
Temperature | Decrease | Shift to release heat energy
Volume/Pressure | Increase volume/Decrease pressure | Shift toward side with larger number of moles of gas
Volume/Pressure | Decrease volume/Increase pressure | Shift toward side with smaller number of moles of gas
Catalysts | Add | Increase speed of reaction - **NO SHIFT**
Catalysts | Remove | Decrease speed of reaction - **NO SHIFT**
Inert Gas | Add | **NO CHANGE**
Inert Gas | Remove | **NO CHANGE**
