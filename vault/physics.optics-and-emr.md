## Terms

Normal: Vector perpendicular to surface  
Light ray: Path of light  
Virtual light ray: Path of light if it does something weird (reflect off a lens or refracting through a mirror)  
Image: Point where 2 or more light rays intersect  
Virtual image: Image formed from virtual light rays  
Principal axis: Line perpendicular to center of lens

## Reflection

-   Angle of incidence = angle of reflection ($θ_1 = θ_2$)
-   Angles measured from the normal

## Refraction

-   Bending of rays due to difference in refractive index ($n$)
-   Air: $n=1$

## Snell's law

-   $n_1\sin{θ_1}=n_2\sin{θ_2}$
-   $n_1$: incident index
-   $n_2$: refracted index
-   $θ_1$: incident angle (measured from normal)
-   $θ_2$: refracted angle (measured from normal)

## Thin Lens Equation

-   $\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}$
-   $f$: focal length
-   $d_o$: distance to object
-   $d_i$: distance to image

## Lenses

-   Image upright when formed above principal axis, inverted when below
-   2 types for Physics 30:
    -   Converging or biconvex (both sides curve outward)
        -   In parallel: Out toward focal point
        -   In toward focal point: Out parallel
        -   In toward center of curvature: Out through center of curvature (no change)
    -   Diverging or biconcave (both sides curve inward)
        -   In parallel: Virtual rays to focal point (Out away from focal point)
        -   In toward focal point: Out parallel
        -   In toward center of curvature: Out through center of curvature (no change)

## Light as a Wave

-   Light contains two waves, each orthagonal to each other
-   One of these waves can be filtered out through polarization
    -   Two polarizing filters perpendicular to each other allow no light through
-   As a wave, light can interfere with itself
    -   Antinodes show up as bright spots
    -   Nodes show up as darkness
    -   Central antinode is called central maxima - $n=0$
    -   Each node to the side increments by 1 - $n=1,2,3,...$

### Young's Experiment

-   Interference of light
-   Several slits to produce interference pattern
-   Wavelength of light can be calculated by $λ=\frac{xd}{nl}$, or $λ=\frac{d\sin{θ}}{n}$ for $θ>10$, where $x$ is the distance between the antinodes, $l$ is the distance between the grating and the screen
