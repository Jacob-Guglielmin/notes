## Terms
Normal: Vector perpendicular to surface
Virtual image: Image formed from virtual light rays (focal point does not exist)
Real image: Image formed from rays which intersect at a real focal point
Principal axis: Line perpendicular to center of lens

## Reflection
* EMR 'bouncing' off a surface
* Angle of incidence = angle of reflection ($θ_1 = θ_2$)
* Angles measured from the normal

## Refraction
* Bending of rays due to difference in refractive index ($n$)
* Air: $n=1$

## Snell's law
* $n_1\sin{θ_1}=n_2\sin{θ_2}$
* $n_1$: incident index
* $n_2$: refracted index
* $θ_1$: incident angle (measured from normal)
* $θ_2$: refracted angle (measured from normal)

## Thin Lens Equation
* $\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}$
* $f$: focal length
* $d_o$: distance to object
* $d_i$: distance to image

## Lenses
* Image upright when formed above principal axis, inverted when below
* 2 types for Physics 30:
    * Converging or biconvex (both sides curve outward)
        * In parallel: Out toward focal point
        * In toward focal point: Out parallel
        * In toward center of curvature: Out through center of curvature (no change)
    * Diverging or biconcave (both sides curve inward)
        * In parallel: Virtual rays to focal point (Out away from focal point)
        * In toward focal point: Out parallel
        * In toward center of curvature: Out through center of curvature (no change)
