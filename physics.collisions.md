## Linear Momentum

* Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system's mass and its velocity, and typically denoted as $p$ $(p=mv)$
* Linear momentum is a vector, with the same direction as the system's velocity
* In SI units, linear momentum is expressed in $kg·m/s$
* Newton's second law can be expressed in terms of momentum: $F_{net}=\frac{Δp}{Δt}$
    * The net external force acting on a system is equal to the change in momentum over the time that the force acts
    * This is essentially the same as $F=ma$, but does not assume that the mass of the system remains constant

## Impulse

* Impulse is defined as a change in momentum
    * By rearranging Newton's second law, we can obtain the formula $Δp=F_{net}Δt$
    * A change in momentum is given by the average external force multiplied by the time over which the force acts
* It is important to note that $F_{net}$ is an **average** force, and force applied over time is basically never constant
    * This can often be mostly ignored by finding a single average force that produces the same result as if the force were not applied evenly, as shown below:

## Conservation of Momentum

* Momentum is an important quantity, because it is always conserved inside an isolated system
    * This principle is written as $p_{tot}=p'_{tot}$ when $F_{net}=0$
* This principle demonstrates that in a collision between two objects, $Δp_1+Δp_2$ must be equal to $0$, as they must be equal and opposite
