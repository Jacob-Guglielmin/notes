## What is Thermochemistry?

* Thermochemistry is the study of energy changes in a system during a chemical reaction
* Energy and matter can usually be exchanged between a system and its surroundings
    * Open system: Both matter and energy can be exchanged with surroundings, such as in a beaker
    * Closed system: Matter cannot be exchanged, but energy can, such as within a sealed flask
    * Isolated system: Neither matter nor energy can be exchanged, such as in a calorimeter

## Definitions

* Enthalpy
    * The total energy of a system
    * Absolute enthalpy cannot be measured, so *changes* in energy are measured instead
* Heat
    * Thermal energy being transferred between systems
* Temperature
    * The **average** thermal energy of all particles of a substance
* Thermal Energy
    * The **total** thermal energy of all particles of a substance

## Important formulas

* $Q=mcΔt$
    * $Q$ (kJ): change in $E_k$ - the quantity of thermal energy transferred
    * $m$ (g): mass
    * $c$ (J/g°C): specific heat capacity
    * $Δt$ (°C): change in temperature
    * Example: Determine the change in thermal energy when 115 mL of water is heated from 19.6°C to 98.8°C.
        * $Q = 115\>mL·4.19\>J/g°C·(98.8°C - 19.6°C) = 3.82·10^4\>J = 3.82\>kJ$
* $ΔH_r=nΔH$
    * $ΔH_r$ (kJ): enthalpy change of reaction
    * $n$ (mol): moles of substance
    * $ΔH$ (kJ/mol): molar enthalpy - **standard value** - will be given by either data booklet or question
    * Example: What is the enthalpy change when 50 g of chlorine vaporizes?
        * $ΔH_r = 50\>g\>Cl_2·\frac{1\>mol\>Cl_2}{79.90\>g\>Cl_2}·\frac{20.41\>kJ}{1\>mol\>Cl_2} = 14\>kJ$
