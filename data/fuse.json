  The net external force acting on a system is equal to the change in momentum over the time that the force acts\n    -   This is essentially the same as $F=ma$, but does not assume that the mass of the system remains constant\n\n## Impulse\n\n-   Impulse is defined as a change in momentum\n    -   By rearranging Newton's second law, we can obtain the formula $Δp=F_{net}Δt$\n        -   For a system with a constant mass, $Δp=mΔv$, so impulse can be defined for these systems as $F_{net}Δt=mΔv$\n    -   A change in momentum is given by the average external force multiplied by the time over which the force acts\n    -   Using these formulas, we can see that we can decrease the force on an object by having the force applied over a longer time\n        -   For example, an airbag or seatbelt increases the time that a passenger will have some sort of force stopping them, and therefore the average force applied will be lower\n-   It is important to note that $F_{net}$ is an **average** force, and force applied over time is basically never constant\n\n    -   This can often be mostly ignored by finding a single average force that produces the same result as if the force were not applied evenly, as shown below:\n\n    ![](/assets/images/2022-02-02-10-35-51.png)\n\n## Conservation of Momentum\n\n-   Momentum is an important quantity, because it is always conserved inside an isolated system\n    -   This principle is written as $p_{tot}=p'_{tot}$ when $F_{net}=0$\n-   This principle demonstrates that in a collision between two objects, $Δp_1+Δp_2$ must be equal to $0$, as they must be equal and opposite\n    -   In addition, $p_1+p_2$ must equal $p'_1+p'_2$\n\n## Elastic vs. Inelastic Collisions\n\n-   Elastic collisions maintain kinetic energy before and after, ie. $E_k=E'_k$\n    -   Examples include billiard balls, where the balls bounce perfectly without deformation\n-   Inelastic collisions do **not** have to maintain the kinetic energy of the system\n    -   Examples include a car crash, where energy is spent to compress the front of the car\n","n":0.052}}},{"i":7,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chemistry","n":1}}},{"i":8,"$":{"0":{"v":"Equilibrium","n":1}}},{"i":9,"$":{"0":{"v":"General Equilibrium","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n## Types of Equilibrium\n\n-   Phase equilibrium\n    -

if this is the case, the benzene ring is called a phenyl branch, and named as other branches (Ex. 3-phenyl)\n-   Branches off benzene rings can also be referred to in another way: 1,2- can be replaced with o-, 1,3- with m-, and 1,4- with p-\n\n## Carboxylic Acids\n\n-   A hydrocarbon with a $COOH$ on the end\n    -   Named by naming normally, removing the \"-e\" at the end and adding \"-oic acid\"\n    -   Ex. methane → methanoic acid\n-   The carbon that is part of the $COOH$ group is still considered part of the parent chain\n\n## Alcohols\n\n-   A hydrocarbon with an $OH$ group\n-   Named by naming normally, changing the \"-e\" at the end to \\*position of $OH$ group\\* + \"-ol\"\n    -   Ex. propane → propan-2-ol\n\n## Condensation Reactions\n\n-   Sometimes called esterification reactions\n-   $carboxylic\\>acid + alcohol → ester$\n-   $H$ from $OH$ group on carboxylic acid and $OH$ from alcohol come off to form $H_2O$, and the carboxylic acid's new $O$ bonds to the $C$ exposed on the alcohol - The $O$ joining the two together is called an ester linkage\n-   ![](/assets/images/2022-05-25-09-00-56.png)\n","n":0.037}}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"Electrochemistry","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Terms\n\n-   Oxidation: Losing electrons\n-   Reduction: Gaining electrons\n-   Oxidizing agent: A substance that causes the oxidization of another substance by undergoing reduction\n-   Reducing agent: A substance that causes the reduction of another substance by undergoing oxidization\n-   Disproportionation reaction: Reaction in which reducing agent and oxidizing agent are the same substance\n-   Half-reaction: Each reaction in redox is called a half-reaction -

  Ex. $CO_2$ has a charge of $0$. Since each $O$ must have a charge of $-2$, and there are 2 of them, the charge required to balance it is $+4$. Therefore, the $C$ has an oxidation number of $+4$.\n-   In all polyatomic ions, the oxidation numbers **MUST** add up to the charge on the ion\n\n## Balancing using Oxidation Numbers\n\n-   Redox reactions can be balanced by looking at the change in the oxidation numbers\n-   The total increase in oxidation numbers in the reaction is always equal to the total decrease\n\n## Spontaneity of Redox Reactions\n\n-   A spontaneous redox reaction will only occur if the oxidizing agent is above the reducing agent in the table of relative strengths in the data booklet\n-   If they are at the same level, it is also non-spontaneous\n-   In the data table:\n    -   Oxidizing agents are on the left, with the strongest at the top, whereas reducing agents are on the right with the strongest at the bottom\n    -   Oxidation half-reactions are read left to right, whereas reduction half-reactions are read right to left\n\n## Building Redox Tables\n\n-   Redox tables can be created using evidence from reactions\n-   We know redox reactions will only occur naturally if the oxidizing agent is above the reducing agent\n    -   Therefore, when a reaction does not occur, the reducing agent must be above the oxidizing agent\n    -   We also know that if a reaction occurs, the oxidizing agent must be above the reducing agent\n-   Using only these rules, we can work out the table like a logic puzzle\n","n":0.042}}},{"i":16,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chem 20 Review","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n## Compound Naming Practice\n\n1. sodium chloride: NaCl\n2. aluminum iodide: AlI<sub>3</sub>\n3. triselenium pentasulfide: Se<sub>3</sub>S<sub>5</sub>\n4. nitric acid: HNo<sub>3</sub>\n5. silver bromide: AgBr\n6. bromine: Br\n7. potassium dichromate: K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>\n8. sulfuric acid: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>\n9. argon: Ar\n10. glucose: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>\n11. aluminum sulphide: Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>\n12. copper (II) oxide: CuO\n13. hydrophosphoric acid: H<sub>3</sub>P\n14. lead (II) chloride: PbCl<sub>2</sub>\n15. sodium nitrate decahydrate: NaNo<sub>3</sub>×10H<sub>2</sub>O\n16. calcium chloride pentahydrate: CaCl<sub>2</sub>×5H<sub>2</sub>O\n17. barium hydroxide: Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n18. magnesium silicate: MgSiO<sub>3</sub>\n19. diphosphorus pentaoxide: P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>\n20. ammonium sulfate: (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>\n21. sodium hydrogen carbonate: NaHCO<sub>3</sub>\n22. magnesium phosphide: Mg<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>\n23.
