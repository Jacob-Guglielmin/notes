### Fomulas

$q$: charge  
$V$: voltage  
$k$: Coulomb's constant ($9×10^9$)  
$e$: Elementary charge ($1.6×10^{-19}\>C$)  
$B$: Magnetic field  
$I$: Current

### Diagrams

x : magnetic field pointing away  
**·** : magnetic field pointing toward

## Terms

Solenoid: A coil of wire around a ferromagnetic material

## Coulomb's Law

-   $F_e=\frac{k|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$
-   Attractive and repulsive
    -   Attractive when $q_1$ and $q_2$ have opposite signs
    -   Repulsive when $q_1$ and $q_2$ have the same signs

## Voltage

-   Voltage is electric potential energy
    -   As energy, it obeys the laws of thermodynamics

## Current

-   Measured in amps
    -   $I=\frac{q}{t}$

## Electric Field of Point Charge

-   $|E|=\frac{k|q|}{r^2}$

## Magnetism

-   There are 2 forms of magnetism:
    -   Magnetic field in space
    -   Originating from a moving charge
-   Magnetic force: $F_b=qvB\sin{θ}$ **OR** $F_b=IlB\sin{θ}$

### Hand Rules for Magnetism

#### Magnetic Fields

Index finger: Field lines  
Thumb: Direction of motion of charge  
Middle: Direction of magnetic force  
Left hand: -, unconventional current  
Right hand: +, conventional current

#### Current

Thumb: Direction of current  
Fingers: Roll in direction of magnetic field  
Left hand: -, unconventional current  
Right hand: +, conventional current

## Lenz's Law

NO FORMULAS FOR LENZ'S LAW IN PHYSICS 30

-   Magnetic fields generated by a moving particle will oppose the particle
    -   Particle moving → will generate a magnetic field S-N
-   Currents generated by a moving magnet will oppose the motion of the magnet
    -   Magnet moving → will generate a current ←
-   In a solenoid, current will flow through the coil in the direction of the north side of the resulting magnetic field
