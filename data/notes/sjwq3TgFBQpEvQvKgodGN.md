## Vector addition (2D)

-   A vector is any line given by its magnitude and direction from a point
    -   Example: The vector from the origin to $(1,1)$ can be represented as $angle=\frac{π}{4},\>magnitude=\sqrt{2}$
-   Any vector can be broken down into an $x$ and $y$ component by simply using $\sin{}$ and $\cos{}$
    -   Our example vector ($angle=\frac{π}{4},\>magnitude=\sqrt{2}$), can be converted to $x=\sqrt{2}\cos{\frac{π}{4}}=1,\>y=\sqrt{2}\sin{\frac{π}{4}}=1$
-   This process can also be done in reverse:
    -   $x=1,y=1$ can be converted to $angle=\arctan{(y/x)}=\frac{π}{4},\>magnitude=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{2}$
-   Using the $x$ and $y$ components of multiple vectors, they can easily be added together.
    -   Our example vector can be added to the vector $angle=\frac{π}{2},\>magnitude=1$ by breaking each down into its $x$ and $y$ components, and using $x_a+x_b=x$ and $y_a+y_b=y$ to produce $x=1+1=2$ and $y=1+0=1$.
    -   Using the new $x$ and $y$ components, we can create our vector:
        -   $angle=\arctan{(1/2)}\approx0.43,\>magnitude=\sqrt{2^2+1^2}\approx2.24$
