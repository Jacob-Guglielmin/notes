## What is Calorimetry?

-   Calorimetry is the practice of using a calorimeter to measure energy changes in a chemical reaction
-   A calorimeter is an insulated chamber containing a thermometer and full of water
    -   A reaction can be performed within the chamber, and any energy changes will affect the temperature of the water, eventually reaching equilibrium
    -   Using the temerature change of the water, the energy absorbed or released by the reaction can be calculated

## Assumptions

-   No energy is lost to the environment
-   The specific heat capacity of a dilute solution is the same as water
-   The specific heat capacity of water is constant over all temperatures
-   The density of dilute solutions is the same as water ($1\>mL=1\>g$)
-   The energy absorbed by the calorimeter itself is negligible
