## Linear Momentum

-   Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system's mass and its velocity, and typically denoted as $p$ $(p=mv)$
-   Linear momentum is a vector, with the same direction as the system's velocity
-   In SI units, linear momentum is expressed in $kg×m/s$
-   Newton's second law can be expressed in terms of momentum: $F_{net}=\frac{Δp}{Δt}$
    -   The net external force acting on a system is equal to the change in momentum over the time that the force acts
    -   This is essentially the same as $F=ma$, but does not assume that the mass of the system remains constant

## Impulse

-   Impulse is defined as a change in momentum
    -   By rearranging Newton's second law, we can obtain the formula $Δp=F_{net}Δt$
        -   For a system with a constant mass, $Δp=mΔv$, so impulse can be defined for these systems as $F_{net}Δt=mΔv$
    -   A change in momentum is given by the average external force multiplied by the time over which the force acts
    -   Using these formulas, we can see that we can decrease the force on an object by having the force applied over a longer time
        -   For example, an airbag or seatbelt increases the time that a passenger will have some sort of force stopping them, and therefore the average force applied will be lower
-   It is important to note that $F_{net}$ is an **average** force, and force applied over time is basically never constant

    -   This can often be mostly ignored by finding a single average force that produces the same result as if the force were not applied evenly, as shown below:

## Conservation of Momentum

-   Momentum is an important quantity, because it is always conserved inside an isolated system
    -   This principle is written as $p_{tot}=p'_{tot}$ when $F_{net}=0$
-   This principle demonstrates that in a collision between two objects, $Δp_1+Δp_2$ must be equal to $0$, as they must be equal and opposite
    -   In addition, $p_1+p_2$ must equal $p'_1+p'_2$

## Elastic vs. Inelastic Collisions

-   Elastic collisions maintain kinetic energy before and after, ie. $E_k=E'_k$
    -   Examples include billiard balls, where the balls bounce perfectly without deformation
-   Inelastic collisions do **not** have to maintain the kinetic energy of the system
    -   Examples include a car crash, where energy is spent to compress the front of the car
